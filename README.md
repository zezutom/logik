## Main Features

* Reliable passing of the logging context. Trace ID and other custom information is reliably transferred regardless of the underlying technology.
* Supports multiple technologies. Primarily built on coroutines, logiK also supports reactive streams or completable futures and knows how to bridge the gap between them, so that no information is lost in hybrid environments.
* Convenient to use. logiK doesn't force you to learn a new DSL or concepts and plays well with Spring Boot.
* Well documented with plenty of examples.
